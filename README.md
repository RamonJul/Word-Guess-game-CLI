## How it works 
On activating the program the user is prompted if they would like to play the game. If the user says yes then the game will initialize. Otherwise it will ask the user again if they want to play. If they said yes the program will randomly select a word and present it to the user. If the user guesses corretly the word will update with and if they didn't then the game wil tell the user that they are wrong and that they have x amount of lives left. If the player succeeds then the game will show them the next word. If they failed then the game will show them what the word wasand asks then if they want to play again. If they said yes then the word list availability will reset and the game will start over again. If the said no then the game will just lead them back to the beginning.
